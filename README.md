# open-reactor


1. Development Environment:
- While Arduino IDE is an option, I would recommend using PlatformIO instead for this project because:
  - Better code organization and project management
  - Built-in library management
  - Support for multiple platforms
  - Better debugging capabilities
  - Professional-grade IDE features when used with VS Code

2. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):
- Given the complexity of the system with multiple control loops and timing requirements, using an RTOS is crucial
- FreeRTOS would be a good choice as it's:
  - Well-supported on both SAMD51 and RP2040
  - Has robust task scheduling
  - Provides synchronization primitives
  - Has a small footprint

3. Code Structure:
- I've provided a starting point with the code above that includes:
  - Task-based architecture using FreeRTOS
  - PID control implementation
  - Sensor reading and control loops
  - Basic MQTT communication structure
  - Proper resource sharing with mutexes

4. Next Steps:
1. Set up PlatformIO
2. Create two separate projects for SAMD51 and RP2040
3. Install required libraries:
   - FreeRTOS
   - PubSubClient (for MQTT)
   - ArduinoJson
   - Wire (I2C)
   - SPI
   - Any specific sensor libraries

5. Implementation Strategy:
1. Start with basic sensor reading functionality
2. Implement each control loop separately
3. Add communication between controllers
4. Implement safety features and alarms
5. Add data logging and MQTT communication
6. Implement user interface integration

Would you like me to provide more specific details about any of these aspects or help you set up the development environment? Also, I can help modify the code for specific features or requirements you'd like to implement first.

The code above is a starting point and would need to be customized based on your specific:
- Sensor types and interfaces
- Control parameters
- Communication requirements
- Safety requirements
